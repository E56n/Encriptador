# Text Encryption Challenge

## Introduction

This is a way to implement Challenge Based Learning, which means learning through challenges, a method created with Apple's help. The Text Encryption Challenge is key to success as a developer. Through practice and the refinement of logic, you will strengthen your knowledge, master logical thinking, improve problem analysis and resolution, and expand your perspective on the development world.

## Training

This project is part of the **Beginner in Programming G7 - ONE** training. It is designed as an introductory guide for those who want to enter the programming universe and start creating web pages using the popular languages **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Description

The Text Encryption Challenge involves creating a web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text. The application also provides functionality to copy the processed text to the clipboard and shows notifications to inform the user about the success of the operations.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Uses basic base64 encoding and decoding functions to transform text.
- **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS for users to interact with the application.
- **Notifications**: Displays notifications when the text is copied to the clipboard.
- **View Reset**: Adjusts the application's view when the text field is empty.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page content.
- **CSS**: Styles and design of the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for encrypting, decrypting, copying text, and managing the view.
